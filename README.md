# 🛒 MERN Stack E-Commerce Project

This is a simple E-Commerce application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to view, sort, and filter products, and simulate purchases with a "Buy Now" feature.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- View all available products
- Sort products by price
- Filter products by:
  - Price range
  - Category (Men / Women)
- Add items to cart
- Remove items from cart
- Display cart items
- Buy Now (with total price calculation)
- Products are fetched from a MongoDB backend
- Admin Dashboard (for product management)

## 📦 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React
- Context API for state management
- Axios for API calls

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
